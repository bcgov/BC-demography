## Plot the age distribution of British Columbia & Canada, 1971â€“present

### data


Source:
Statistics Canada, CANSIM 
[Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)

Table: 17-10-0005-01 (formerly CANSIM 051-0001)

The source file contains population for Canada, the provinces and territories, by age (and age group), and by sex, for the years 1976-2020 (as of this writing).

Source file:  (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000501)


The CANSIM extract requires some carpentry to be useful for the purposes of this plotting. The tidied version becomes a data frame `data_age_groupdistrib_BC_2019`.

**Notes:** 

1. The table originally tabulated the last category as "90 years and over"; starting with 2001 this category was expanded to single years 90 through 99, and a "100 years and over" category was added. Depending on the year(s) of interest, the treatment of the extreme category will vary. 

2. The extreme age_group categories appear for all years, but are empty values. These lead to "parsing failures" when reading the source .csv file.


Read and clean data

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message_group=FALSE}

# read the data
#df_1710000501 <- read_rds("../data_source/df_1710000501.rds")
df_1710000501 <- cansim::get_cansim("17-10-0005-01")

df_1710000501 <- janitor::clean_names(df_1710000501)

df_1710000501
```





Filter so that only single year categories remain (i.e. age 0, 1, 2, etc)

**Note:** the years up to and including 2000 include "90 years and over" as the oldest category; in 2001 the years 90-99 were included as single years, and the oldest category became "100 years and over". To make a data frame with single categories

* for those years, the 90+ category needs to be reframed as the single year "90"

* for the other years, the 90+ category needs to be dropped entirely

### Plot: population pyramid, British Columbia `r year_max`

This set of charts shows the distribution of the B.C. population by sex, by one year age_group groups.

The first group shows the absolute number of people, and the second shows the percentage_group of the population in each group (useful for comparisons across time).


The first version of the plot is a basic version. The second version adds an assortment of formatting:

* axis length and grid specifications
* axis titles
* chart title, subtitle, and source




```{r}

pl_bc_pyramid <- ggplot(data_age_BC_max, aes(x = age_group.num, fill = sex,
                 y = ifelse(test = sex == "Males",
                            yes = -value, no = value))) + 
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs, 
                     limits = max(data_age_BC_max$value) * c(-1,1),
                     breaks = seq(-40000, 40000, by = 10000)) +
  coord_flip()

pl_bc_pyramid
```



```{r}

pl_bc_pyramid + 
#  theme_BCStats +
  scale_fill_manual(values=palette_BCStats) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)) +
  labs(title = "British Columbia: age distribution",
       subtitle = year_max,
       y = "population", x = "age",
       caption = txt_caption) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

#ggsave(plot_file_name, width=9, height=6)

## Summary statistics

Questions:

- what percentage_group of British Columbians are 65 and older?
- how many school-age_group children are there?
- when was the peak in school age_group children?

-30-
