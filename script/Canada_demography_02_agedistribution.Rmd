## Plot the age distribution of British Columbia & Canada, 1971â€“present

### data


Source:
Statistics Canada, CANSIM 
[Projected population, by projection scenario, age and sex, as of July 1 (x 1,000)](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710005701)
Frequency: Annual

Table: 17-10-0057-01 (formerly CANSIM 052-0005)


Read and clean data

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message_group=FALSE}

# read the data
df_1710005701 <- get_cansim("17-10-0057-01")

df_1710005701 <- clean_names(df_1710005701)

Filter so that only single year categories remain (i.e. age 0, 1, 2, etc)

**Note:** the years up to and including 2000 include "90 years and over" as the oldest category; in 2001 the years 90-99 were included as single years, and the oldest category became "100 years and over". To make a data frame with single categories

* for those years, the 90+ category needs to be reframed as the single year "90"

* for the other years, the 90+ category needs to be dropped entirely

```{r}
