Function to aggregate demographic series into 5 year age bins

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# load the tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)

# utilities
library(glue)
library(here)
library(janitor)
#
library(cansim)


```


```{r read_data}

# read the data
df_indigenous_pop <- read_csv(here("data_source", "2011-2044 BC Indigenous Population Estimates and Projections 2019-05-06.csv"))

df_indigenous_pop <- clean_names(df_indigenous_pop)

```

### aggregation



```{r}

age_seq <- tibble(
  age = seq(0, 17, 1))

age_seq %<>% 
  # use modulus division to get the subsets of 5
  mutate(age_grp = age %/% 5) %>% 
  mutate(age_5yr_grp =
           case_when(
             age_grp == 0 ~ "Less than 5",
             TRUE ~ as.character(glue('{age_grp * 5} to {age_grp * 5 + 4}')) 
           )) %>% 
  select(-age_grp)


```


```{r}

df_indigenous_pop <-
df_indigenous_pop %>% 
  # use modulus division to get the subsets of 5
  mutate(age_grp = age %/% 5) %>% 
  mutate(age_5yr_grp =
           case_when(
             age_grp == 0 ~ "Less than 5",
             age_grp == 18 ~ "90 and over",
             TRUE ~ as.character(glue('{age_grp * 5} to {age_grp * 5 + 4}')) 
           )) 

df_indigenous_pop  

```

```{r}

df_indigenous_pop %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, age_grp, age_5yr_grp) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(n))

```

## single year summary table

```{r}
# set year
filter_year <- 2021

data_indigenous_pop_5yrgrp <-
df_indigenous_pop %>% 
  filter(year == filter_year) %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, hsda, identity, age_grp, age_5yr_grp) %>% 
  summarise(population = sum(n))

data_indigenous_pop_5yrgrp

# save as csv file
file_name <- glue("../data_output/data_indigenous_pop_5yrgrp_{filter_year}.csv")
write_csv(data_indigenous_pop_5yrgrp, file_name)

```
